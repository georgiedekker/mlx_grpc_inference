Pattern recognition: Identifying patterns and relationships in data\n3. Generalization: Applying learned patterns to new, unseen data\n4. Optimization: Finding the best parameters to minimize error\n5. Feature extraction: Identifying relevant characteristics in data",

    "input": "Neural networks",
    "output": "Neural networks are computer systems inspired by the human brain. Imagine a network of interconnected nodes (like brain cells) that work together to solve problems. Each node receives information, processes it, and passes it along. Through training, the network learns to recognize patterns - like how you learned to recognize faces or read words. They're used in everything from voice assistants to image recognition.",

    "output": "Supervised learning uses labeled data where the algorithm learns from input-output pairs (like learning with a teacher). Examples include classification and regression. Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data to find hidden patterns or structures (like learning on your own). Examples include clustering and dimensionality reduction. Supervised learning predicts specific outcomes, while unsupervised learning discovers underlying patterns.",
