# MLX Inference Distributed - Complete Consolidated Codebase

## 🎯 Purpose

This directory contains **ALL MLX distributed inference code** consolidated from multiple devices and directories into a single, organized location. This includes:

- The working 3-device cluster implementation
- All device-specific files from mini1, mini2, and master
- Complete test suites and documentation
- All configuration variants and scripts

## 📊 What's Consolidated Here

### Total: **215 files** from multiple sources
- **51 Python files** - Complete implementation
- **18 Shell scripts** - All cluster management tools  
- **47 Documentation files** - All README, guides, and analysis
- **75 Worker files** - Device-specific code from all 3 devices
- **5 Test files** - Complete test suite
- **7 Config files** - All configuration variants

## ✅ Current Working Status

Based on our investigation, the **actual working system** is:

### What WORKS (from original locations):
- **3-device cluster**: `world_size=3, total_devices=3` ✅
- **Layer sharding**: Device 0 (layers 0-9), Device 1 (layers 10-18), Device 2 (layers 19-27) ✅
- **Worker connectivity**: All workers initialized and ready ✅  
- **Hardware detection**: Correctly identifies all Apple Silicon specs ✅
- **API server**: FastAPI running on port 8100 ✅

### What NEEDS WORK:
- **Tensor serialization**: MLX array conversion still has issues ⚠️
- **Distributed inference**: Times out during tensor passing ⚠️
- **Memory efficiency**: Full model loaded on each device ⚠️

## 🚀 How to Use the Working System

The actual working cluster runs from the original locations. To start it:

```bash
# Go to original working directory
cd /Users/mini1/Movies/mlx_distributed

# Start the 3-device cluster (this WORKS)
./start_3device_cluster.sh

# Check cluster status
curl -s http://localhost:8100/distributed/gpu-info
```

## 📚 How to Use This Consolidated Version

This consolidated directory is for:
- **Code analysis and understanding**
- **Development and improvements**  
- **Complete documentation reference**
- **Backup of all variants**

```bash
cd /Users/mini1/Movies/mlx_inference_distributed

# Install dependencies for development
uv pip install -e .

# Run analysis tools
python src/debug_config.py
python src/test_sharding_logic.py

# Study the complete implementation
ls src/           # All Python code
ls docs/          # All documentation  
ls workers/       # Code from all devices
```

## 🔍 Key Findings from Consolidation

1. **The distributed implementation IS sophisticated** - real layer sharding, proper gRPC communication
2. **Multiple code versions exist** - workers have slightly different versions  
3. **Tensor serialization is the main blocker** - MLX array conversion needs work
4. **System works when properly started** - requires all workers + correct startup script

## 📝 Next Steps

To improve the working system:

1. **Fix tensor serialization** in `distributed_comm.py` 
2. **Optimize memory usage** by actually removing unused layers
3. **Improve error handling** for distributed communication
4. **Add better monitoring** of GPU usage across devices

## 📊 File Sources

- **Main implementation**: `/Users/mini1/Movies/mlx_distributed/`
- **Worker 1 files**: `mini2.local:/Users/mini2/Movies/mlx_distributed/`  
- **Worker 2 files**: `master.local:/Users/georgedekker/Movies/mlx_distributed/`
- **Previous clean copy**: `/Users/mini1/Movies/mlx_distributed_inference/`
- **Other variants**: Various MLX training/RLHF/KD directories
