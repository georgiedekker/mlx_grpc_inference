# MLX Distributed Inference - Working Status

## Current State

The distributed inference system is **partially working**:

✅ **What's Working:**
- 3-device cluster properly initialized (world_size=3)
- Model shards loaded on each device (layers 0-9, 10-18, 19-27)
- gRPC communication established between all devices
- GPU activity visible on all 3 devices during inference attempts
- Tensor serialization fixed for MLX arrays

❌ **What's Not Working:**
- Overcomplicated barrier synchronization causing timeouts
- Workers expecting synchronized execution (MPI-style) instead of simple pipeline
- API requests timeout after tensor passing starts

## The Real Issue

The system is overengineered. It's trying to implement MPI-style collective operations when all that's needed is simple pipeline parallelism like mlx_sharding:

1. Device 0: Process layers 0-9 → send to Device 1
2. Device 1: Receive → process layers 10-18 → send to Device 2  
3. Device 2: Receive → process layers 19-27 → compute logits → done

## Quick Fix

To make it work, we need to:
1. Remove all barrier() calls 
2. Simplify worker to just handle gRPC requests
3. Let the tensor passing flow naturally through devices

The infrastructure is all there - it just needs simplification to work properly.

## Alternative

Consider using https://github.com/mzbac/mlx_sharding which implements this pattern correctly with simple pipeline parallelism.
