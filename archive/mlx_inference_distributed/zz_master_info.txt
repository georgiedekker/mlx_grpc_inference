 Here's the complete information about master.local that mini1.local
  should be aware of:

  System Information

  - Hostname: master.local
  - User: georgedekker
  - Home Directory: /Users/georgedekker
  - IP Address: 192.168.2.106
  - Hardware: MacBook Pro (Mac16,8) - Apple Silicon
  - OS: macOS 26.0 (Build 25A5316i)

  SSH Connection Details

  To connect from mini1.local to master.local:
  Host master.local
    HostName master.local  # or use 192.168.2.106
    User georgedekker
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_master  # (key needs to be set up)
    IdentitiesOnly yes
    UseKeychain yes
    AddKeysToAgent yes

  For gRPC Configuration

  - Server Host: master.local or 192.168.2.106
  - Default Ports: Check what port your MLX gRPC server is using (commonly
  50051, 8080, etc.)


Perfect! SSH key exchange is now set up successfully between mini1.local
  and master.local.


  ✅ SSH Connection Configured
  - mini1.local can now connect to master.local using ssh master.local
  - Uses dedicated key: ~/.ssh/mlx_master_key
  - Connection tested and working

  Connection Details:
  - From: mini1.local
  - To: master.local (192.168.2.106)
  - User: georgedekker
  - Home: /Users/georgedekker


  Your distributed LLM setup should now be able to use gRPC communication
  between the devices. mini1.local can reach master.local for GPU compute
  tasks using MLX.


 Perfect! All SSH connections are now working. Let me do a final
  verification of all connections:

⏺ Bash(ssh mini1.local "ssh mini2.local whoami" && ssh mini2.local "ssh
      mini1.local whoami" && ssh mini1.local "ssh master.local whoami" &&
      ssh mini2.local "ssh master…)
  ⎿  mini2                       
     mini1
     georgedekker
     … +1 line (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Excellent! SSH key exchange is now fully configured between all devices.

  Summary - SSH Configuration Complete ✅

  Bidirectional SSH Communication Verified:
  - ✅ mini1.local ↔ mini2.local (both directions working)
  - ✅ mini1.local → master.local (working)
  - ✅ mini2.local → master.local (working)

  SSH Key Setup:
  - mini1.local: Uses ~/.ssh/mlx_master_key to connect to master.local
  - mini2.local: Uses ~/.ssh/mlx_master_key to connect to master.local
  - Cross-communication: mini1 ↔ mini2 using their default RSA keys

  Network Topology for Distributed LLM:
  mini1.local ←→ mini2.local
        ↓           ↓
      master.local (GPU/MLX host)
      192.168.2.106
      georgedekker@master.local

  Your distributed LLM setup can now use gRPC communication between all
  three devices, with mini1.local and mini2.local both able to access the
  GPU resources on master.local via MLX.
