# MLX Distributed - Working Implementation Status

## Current Status: PARTIALLY WORKING (Single Device Only)

### ✅ What's Working

1. **API Server**: Running on port 8100
   - Health endpoint: `GET /health`
   - GPU info: `GET /distributed/gpu-info`
   - Chat completions: `POST /v1/chat/completions`
   - Models list: `GET /v1/models`

2. **Tensor Serialization**: Fixed the RuntimeError
   - Changed from `np.array(data)` to `np.asarray(data)` with proper MLX evaluation
   - Added dtype handling for bool arrays

3. **Single Device Inference**: Works correctly
   - Model loads and generates responses
   - OpenAI-compatible API functioning

4. **Hardware Detection**: Correctly identifies Apple Silicon specs

### ❌ What's NOT Working

1. **Multi-Device Distribution**: 
   - System is configured for 3 devices (mini1, mini2, master)
   - Only mini1 is actually running
   - Attempts to connect to non-existent devices fail with DNS errors
   - **No actual model sharding happens** - full model loads on each device

2. **Model Sharding Issues**:
   - Code claims to assign layers to different devices
   - BUT: Never actually removes/nullifies layers from devices
   - Each device would load the FULL model (wasteful)
   - Only processes assigned layers but keeps all in memory

3. **Test Suite**: 39/57 tests pass
   - Multi-device tests fail (expected)
   - Some interface tests need updating

## File Structure Being Used

└── src/mlx_distributed/       # DUPLICATE/STUB - not used
```

## Key Issues Found

1. **Fake Distribution**: The system pretends to distribute work but doesn't actually shard the model
2. **Memory Inefficiency**: Each device would load the full model even if using only some layers
3. **Configuration Mismatch**: Configured for 3 devices but only 1 available

## To Run the Working Single-Device Version

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
uv pip install -e .

# 2. Start the API server
uv run python distributed_api.py

# 3. Test the API
python test_api_fix.py
```

## Recommendation

The current implementation is more of a "distributed inference framework" than actual working distributed inference. To truly distribute:

1. Model layers need to be actually removed from devices that don't need them
2. All configured devices need to be running and accessible
3. The sharding logic needs to be implemented properly

The code Team C reviewed is indeed "an elaborate facade" - it has all the structure for distribution but doesn't actually distribute the computational load.
