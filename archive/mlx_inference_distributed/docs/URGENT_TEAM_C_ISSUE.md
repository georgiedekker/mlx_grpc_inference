# 🚨 URGENT: Team C Package Management Issue

## Issue Detected
Team C has created `mlx_rlhf` but is **missing critical UV integration**:

### Current State:
- ✅ Has `pyproject.toml` 
- ✅ Has `setup.py`
- ❌ **Missing `uv.lock`** - No dependency locking!
- ❌ Using Python 3.8+ in config but mlx_distributed uses 3.13.5
- ❌ Not using UV for package management

### Problems This Will Cause:

1. **Dependency Conflicts**:
   - No locked versions = different environments on different machines
   - MLX version mismatch possible (using >=0.5.0 vs mlx_distributed's >=0.22.0)

2. **Python Version Mismatch**:
   - mlx_rlhf: requires-python = ">=3.8"
   - mlx_distributed: Python 3.13.5
   - Could cause compatibility issues

3. **Build System Inconsistency**:
   - Using setuptools instead of hatchling
   - Different build backend from main project

## Recommended Actions for Team C:

### 1. Align Python Version
```toml
# Update pyproject.toml
requires-python = ">=3.13"
```

### 2. Switch to UV
```bash
cd /Users/mini1/Movies/mlx_distributed/mlx_rlhf

# Create .python-version
echo "3.13.5" > .python-version

# Initialize UV
uv venv
uv pip install -e .

# This will create uv.lock automatically
```

### 3. Update Build System
```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages = ["src/mlx_rlhf"]
```

### 4. Update Dependencies to Match
```toml
dependencies = [
    "mlx>=0.22.0",  # Match mlx_distributed version
    "mlx-lm>=0.21.0",  # Match mlx_distributed version
    "numpy>=2.2.1",
    "psutil>=6.1.1",
]
```

## Integration Risk Assessment:

### High Risk:
- Different Python versions could cause runtime errors
- Unlocked dependencies = "works on my machine" syndrome

### Medium Risk:
- Different build systems may complicate CI/CD
- Version conflicts during integration

### Low Risk:
- Currently working in isolation
- Can be fixed before integration

## Immediate Actions Needed:

1. **Stop Team C development temporarily**
2. **Migrate to UV immediately**
3. **Generate uv.lock file**
4. **Align Python and dependency versions**
5. **Resume development with proper setup**

**Coordinator Note**: This needs immediate attention before Team C gets too far with incorrect setup!
