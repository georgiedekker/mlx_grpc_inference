# Team A Completion Plan: True 2-Device Distributed Inference

## 🎯 Mission: Complete Production 2-Device Setup

**Current Status:** Team A has real gRPC implementation but only single-device mode  
**Goal:** True distributed inference across mini1 + mini2 with model sharding  
**Expected Outcome:** `/distributed/gpu-info` shows both devices active

## ⚡ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (4 Hours Total)

### Phase 1: Network & Worker Setup (1 hour)

You need to create a worker script that runs on mini2 and connects to the gRPC cluster.

### Phase 2: Fix Model Sharding (1.5 hours)

Currently the system loads all 28 layers on mini1. You need to:
- Split layers: mini1 gets 0-13, mini2 gets 14-27
- Implement distributed forward pass
- Handle tensor communication between devices

### Phase 3: Fix gRPC Communication (1 hour)

Add proper tensor serialization for large MLX tensors flowing between devices.

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing (30 minutes)

Create launch scripts and test the full 2-device cluster.

## 🎯 Expected Results After Completion

### API Response You Should See:
```json
{
  "devices": [
    {
      "device_id": "mini1",
      "hostname": "mini1.local", 
      "status": "healthy",
      "layers": "0-13",
      "role": "coordinator"
    },
    {
      "device_id": "mini2", 
      "hostname": "mini2.local",
      "status": "healthy", 
      "layers": "14-27",
      "role": "worker"
    }
  ],
  "cluster_status": "healthy",
  "world_size": 2,
  "model_loaded": true,
  "model_name": "mlx-community/Qwen3-1.7B-8bit"
}
```

## 🏆 Current Status

**Team A has successfully implemented:**
✅ Real gRPC communication (no more stubs!)  
✅ Working OpenAI-compatible API  
✅ Model loading and inference on single device  
✅ All MPI dependencies removed  

**Next step:** Enable true distributed inference across both mini1 and mini2!

The roadmap above will get you from single-device to true 2-device distributed inference! 🚀
