# 🚨 Directory Structure Cleanup Needed!

## Current Mess:

### ❌ PROBLEM:
- Team C's knowledge distillation project is INSIDE Team A's directory
- `/Users/mini1/Movies/mlx_distributed/mlx_knowledge_distillation/` ← Team C's work
- `/Users/mini1/Movies/mlx_knowledge_distillation/` ← Empty directory

### This causes:
- Confusion about where Team C's work actually is
- Potential file conflicts between teams
- Unclear ownership and boundaries

---

## 🔧 RECOMMENDED FIX:

### Option 1: Move Team C to correct location
```bash
# Move Team C's work to the proper top-level directory
mv /Users/mini1/Movies/mlx_distributed/mlx_knowledge_distillation \
   /Users/mini1/Movies/mlx_knowledge_distillation
```

### Option 2: Keep as-is but document clearly
- Update all documentation to reflect actual location
- Add clear README in both locations explaining the structure

## 📁 CORRECT Structure Should Be:

```
/Users/mini1/Movies/
├── mlx/                              # Original single-device (keep)
├── mlx_distributed/                  # Team A only
├── mlx_distributed_training/         # Team B only  
├── mlx_knowledge_distillation/       # Team C only
└── mlx_training/                     # Deprecated (remove)
```

---

## 🎯 Action Items:

1. **Decide**: Move Team C's work or keep nested?
2. **Clean**: Remove empty directories
3. **Document**: Update DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE_GUIDE.md
4. **Communicate**: Ensure all teams know correct locations

This nested structure is why we couldn't find Team C's work initially!
