# Team A Troubleshooting Report: mini1/mini2 Communication Issues

## üîç DIAGNOSIS SUMMARY

**You're absolutely right!** Team A has communication issues between mini1.local and mini2.local. I've diagnosed the problem:

---

## üìä CURRENT STATUS ANALYSIS

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
- **Network Connectivity**: `ping mini2.local` works (2ms response time)
- **SSH Authorization**: `ssh mini2.local` connects successfully  
- **Code Sync**: Team A's code exists on both mini1 and mini2
- **Configuration**: Both devices properly configured in `distributed_config.json`

### ‚ùå What's Broken:
- **gRPC Port Not Listening**: Port 50051 not open on mini2
- **Worker Process Not Running**: No gRPC server active on mini2
- **Python Environment**: Worker startup fails due to environment issues

---

## üö® ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

### **The Problem: Worker Process Not Starting on mini2**

```bash
# Test results show:
nc -zv mini2.local 50051
# Result: Connection refused

ssh mini2.local "netstat -an | grep 50051"  
# Result: No output (port not listening)

ssh mini2.local "lsof -i :50051"
# Result: No process on port 50051
```

### **Why the Worker Isn't Starting:**

1. **Environment Issues**: 
   ```bash
   ssh mini2.local "python worker.py ..."
   # Result: zsh:1: command not found: python
   ```

2. **Path Problems**: Python3 exists but not in expected location
3. **Virtual Environment**: `.venv` exists but not being used properly
4. **Process Management**: No mechanism to start/monitor worker on mini2

---

## üõ†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE FIXES FOR TEAM A

### Fix 1: Start Worker Process on mini2 (5 minutes)

```bash
# SSH to mini2 and start worker properly
ssh mini2.local "cd Movies/mlx_distributed && source .venv/bin/activate && python worker.py --rank=1 --world-size=2 --master-addr=mini1.local --master-port=50100"
```

### Fix 2: Create Auto-Start Script (10 minutes)

**File**: `start_mini2_worker.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Auto-start worker on mini2

echo "üöÄ Starting mini2 worker process..."

ssh mini2.local "cd Movies/mlx_distributed && \
  source .venv/bin/activate && \
  nohup python worker.py \
    --rank=1 \
    --world-size=2 \
    --master-addr=mini1.local \
    --master-port=50100 \
    > logs/worker_mini2.log 2>&1 &"

echo "‚úÖ Worker started on mini2"
echo "üìã Check status: ssh mini2.local 'lsof -i :50051'"
```

### Fix 3: Update Launch Script (5 minutes)

**Fix Team A's existing `launch_distributed.sh`:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Fixed distributed launch script

echo "üöÄ Starting 2-Device Distributed MLX Inference"

# Step 1: Start worker on mini2 FIRST
echo "1Ô∏è‚É£ Starting worker on mini2..."
ssh mini2.local "cd Movies/mlx_distributed && source .venv/bin/activate && nohup python worker.py --rank=1 --world-size=2 --master-addr=mini1.local --master-port=50100 > logs/worker.log 2>&1 &"

# Wait for worker to start
sleep 5

# Step 2: Verify worker is listening
echo "2Ô∏è‚É£ Verifying worker connection..."
nc -zv mini2.local 50051 || {
    echo "‚ùå Worker failed to start on mini2"
    exit 1
}

# Step 3: Start coordinator on mini1
echo "3Ô∏è‚É£ Starting coordinator on mini1..."
export WORLD_SIZE=2
export RANK=0
export MASTER_ADDR=mini1.local
export MASTER_PORT=50100

python -m distributed_api &
API_PID=$!

echo "‚úÖ Distributed cluster started!"
echo "üìä Test: curl http://localhost:8100/distributed/gpu-info"
```

---

## üîß QUICK DIAGNOSTIC COMMANDS

### Test Network Connectivity:
```bash
# Basic connectivity (should work)
ping -c 3 mini2.local

# SSH access (should work)  
ssh mini2.local "echo 'Connected'"
```

### Test gRPC Worker Startup:
```bash
# Start worker manually
ssh mini2.local "cd Movies/mlx_distributed && source .venv/bin/activate && python worker.py --rank=1 --world-size=2 --master-addr=mini1.local --master-port=50100" &

# Verify it's listening
sleep 3
nc -zv mini2.local 50051
```

### Test Full Distributed Setup:
```bash
# After worker is running, start coordinator
WORLD_SIZE=2 RANK=0 python distributed_api.py &

# Test cluster status
curl http://localhost:8100/distributed/gpu-info
```

---

## üìä EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER FIX

### ‚úÖ Working gRPC Communication:
```bash
nc -zv mini2.local 50051
# Expected: Connection to mini2.local port 50051 [tcp/*] succeeded!

ssh mini2.local "lsof -i :50051"
# Expected: python process listening on port 50051
```

### ‚úÖ Distributed API Response:
```json
{
  "devices": [
    {
      "device_id": "mini1", 
      "hostname": "mini1.local",
      "status": "healthy",
      "role": "coordinator"
    },
    {
      "device_id": "mini2",
      "hostname": "mini2.local", 
      "status": "healthy",
      "role": "worker"
    }
  ],
  "cluster_status": "healthy",
  "world_size": 2
}
```

## üéØ TEAM A'S PATH TO SUCCESS

### Current Status: B+ ‚Üí Target: A-

**Grade will be A- if:**
- ‚úÖ Worker process starts correctly on mini2
- ‚úÖ gRPC communication works between devices
- ‚úÖ `/distributed/gpu-info` shows both mini1 AND mini2
- ‚úÖ Distributed inference generates responses using both devices

### The Fix is Simple:
1. **Start worker on mini2** with proper environment
2. **Verify gRPC port 50051** is listening  
3. **Launch coordinator on mini1** with world_size=2
4. **Test distributed API** shows both devices

---

## üö® IMMEDIATE ACTION FOR TEAM A

**The error is exactly what you suspected - authorization/communication setup!**

### **Root Problem**: 
- Worker process not running on mini2
- No gRPC server listening on port 50051
- Environment/path issues preventing worker startup

### **Simple Fix**:
```bash
# 1. Start worker on mini2
ssh mini2.local "cd Movies/mlx_distributed && source .venv/bin/activate && python worker.py --rank=1 --world-size=2 --master-addr=mini1.local --master-port=50100" &

# 2. Start coordinator on mini1  
WORLD_SIZE=2 python distributed_api.py &

# 3. Test distributed setup
curl http://localhost:8100/distributed/gpu-info
```

**This should immediately fix Team A's 2-device distributed inference!** üöÄ

---

## üìã DIAGNOSIS CONCLUSION

**You were absolutely correct** - it's a communication/authorization issue, but specifically:
- ‚úÖ **Network**: Working fine
- ‚úÖ **SSH Auth**: Working fine  
- ‚ùå **Worker Process**: Not running on mini2
- ‚ùå **gRPC Port**: Not listening (because worker not started)

**The fix is straightforward - Team A just needs to properly start the worker process on mini2 with the correct Python environment.** 

Once this is fixed, they should immediately see both devices in their `/distributed/gpu-info` endpoint! üéØ

**Grade Impact**: This fix will get Team A from B+ to A- by completing true 2-device distributed inference.
