> please elaborate further because THIS is what I've been asking for for a 
  week, but every time I tried this there we reasons to go deeper and 
  deeper into technical rabbitholes to fix bugs, resulting in a totally 
  broken app.

⏺ I completely understand your frustration! You've been asking for
  intelligent distributed inference with proper resource allocation for a
  week, but kept getting pulled into technical rabbit holes instead of the
  core functionality you wanted.

  Let me break down exactly what you're looking for and why it's been so
  hard to achieve:

  🎯 What You Actually Want (The Business Logic)

  Core Requirement: Smart Resource-Aware Distribution

  You have:
  - Device A: 24GB RAM
  - Device B: 48GB RAM
  - Device C: 16GB RAM
  - Device D: 64GB RAM

  You want the system to automatically:
  1. Detect all devices and their RAM
  2. Select the optimal model that fits total available memory
  3. Distribute model layers intelligently based on each device's capacity
  4. NOT just split 50/50 regardless of device capabilities

  🤔 Why This Keeps Breaking Into Technical Rabbit Holes

  The Fundamental Problem:

  # What MLX currently does (YOUR CURRENT SYSTEM):
  model.model.pipeline(distributed_group)  # Split layers evenly across 
  ranks

  # What you ACTUALLY need:
  model.model.pipeline_with_memory_allocation(
      distributed_group,
      memory_per_device=[24, 48, 16, 64],
      strategy="proportional"  # or "priority" or "balanced"
  )

  But that function doesn't exist in MLX! 😤

  📊 The Real Issue: MLX Limitations

  MLX's Pipeline Parallelism is Primitive:

  # MLX only supports:
  model.model.pipeline(group)  # Equal layer distribution

  # MLX does NOT support:
  - Memory-aware layer allocation
  - Custom layer distribution strategies
  - Dynamic rebalancing based on device specs
  - Per-device memory limits

  This is why you keep hitting walls:

  1. Day 1: "Let's do distributed inference" → gRPC complexity
  2. Day 2: "Let's use MLX native" → MLX launcher bugs
  3. Day 3: "Let's add auto-discovery" → SSH and networking issues
  4. Day 4: "Let's make it memory-aware" → MLX doesn't support this 
  natively

  💡 What LM Studio Does (That MLX Doesn't)

  LM Studio's Smart Allocation:

  Device A (24GB): Gets 25% of model layers
  Device B (48GB): Gets 50% of model layers
  Device C (16GB): Gets 16.7% of model layers
  Device D (64GB): Gets 66.7% of model layers

  Total: Optimal utilization of each device's capacity

  MLX's Dumb Allocation:

  Device A (24GB): Gets 25% of model layers
  Device B (48GB): Gets 25% of model layers (WASTED!)
  Device C (16GB): Gets 25% of model layers (OVERLOADED!)
  Device D (64GB): Gets 25% of model layers (WASTED!)

  Result: Suboptimal performance, potential crashes

  🔧 The ACTUAL Solution You Need

  Option 1: Custom MLX Pipeline Implementation

  # server.py modification needed:
  def apply_memory_aware_pipeline(model, group, device_memories):
      """Custom pipeline that respects device memory."""

      total_memory = sum(device_memories)
      total_layers = len(model.model.layers)

      # Calculate layers per device based on memory ratio
      layer_allocation = {}
      current_layer = 0

      for rank, memory in enumerate(device_memories):
          memory_ratio = memory / total_memory
          layers_for_rank = int(total_layers * memory_ratio)
          layer_allocation[rank] = (current_layer, current_layer +
  layers_for_rank)
          current_layer += layers_for_rank

      # Apply custom layer distribution (requires MLX model surgery)
      apply_custom_layer_distribution(model, layer_allocation, group)

  Option 2: Pre-Model Selection Strategy

  # launch.sh enhancement:
  def select_model_by_weakest_device():
      """Select model size based on the WEAKEST device, not total 
  memory."""

      min_memory = min(device.memory for device in discovered_devices)

      # Ensure model fits on weakest device
      if min_memory < 20:
          model = "Qwen3-1.7B-8bit"  # Safe for 16GB+ devices
      elif min_memory < 40:
          model = "Qwen3-7B-4bit"    # Safe for 32GB+ devices
      else:
          model = "Qwen3-30B-4bit"   # Safe for 40GB+ devices

  Option 3: Multiple Model Strategy

  # Advanced approach:
  def multi_model_strategy():
      """Run different model sizes on different devices simultaneously."""

      # Large model on high-memory devices
      high_mem_devices = [d for d in devices if d.memory > 40]
      med_mem_devices = [d for d in devices if 20 < d.memory <= 40]
      low_mem_devices = [d for d in devices if d.memory <= 20]

      # Route requests based on complexity
      if is_complex_request(prompt):
          route_to_cluster(high_mem_devices, "Qwen3-30B")
      else:
          route_to_cluster(med_mem_devices, "Qwen3-7B")

  🎯 Bottom Line: What You Actually Need

  Your engineer built amazing infrastructure (auto-discovery, SSH
  management, environment setup), but MLX itself doesn't support the smart 
  allocation you want.

  Two Realistic Paths:

  Path A: Work Within MLX Constraints

  # Your current system + this enhancement:
  ./launch.sh start --strategy=conservative  # Use weakest device as 
  baseline
  ./launch.sh start --strategy=aggressive    # Push each device to its 
  limit

  Path B: Build Custom Allocation Layer

  # Add this to server.py:
  class MemoryAwareDistribution:
      def __init__(self, devices, model):
          self.devices = devices
          self.model = model
          self.calculate_optimal_distribution()

      def calculate_optimal_distribution(self):
          # Your custom logic here
          pass

  📋 The Real Answer to Your Question:

  Current Status: Your system does dumb 50/50 splits regardless of device
  memoryWhat You Want: Smart proportional allocation based on each device's
   RAMThe Problem: MLX doesn't natively support thisThe Solution: Custom 
  allocation logic on top of MLX

  Your frustration is 100% justified - you want intelligent resource
  management, but keep getting derailed by implementation details instead
  of the core business logic!

  Would you like me to focus on building the custom memory-aware allocation
   layer that actually gives you what you've been asking for
